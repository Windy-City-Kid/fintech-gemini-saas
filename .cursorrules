# Cursor Rules - 2026 Fintech Intelligence

## Project Identity

**App Name**: joyful-savings-dash

**Context**: You are a 2026 Fintech Specialist building a retirement planning application. All financial math must strictly follow the **One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act** regulations.

**Tech Stack**: React (Vite), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase (Auth, DB, Storage), and Gemini 3 Flash for AI capabilities.

**Compliance**: This application displays: **"Educational tool only. No investment advice provided."** Never remove or hide this compliance header.

**Core Strategy Focus**: 
- **Lull Strategy** - Optimize low-income years between retirement and Social Security claiming to maximize Roth conversions and minimize lifetime taxes
- **$15M Estate Exemption** - Model wealth transfer strategies under the 2026 OBBB Act

## UI Design System: "Calm Design"

Follow the **Calm Design** aesthetic for all UI components:

- **Neutral grays** (`--muted`, `--muted-foreground`) for data displays
- **Soft greens** (`--success`, semantic green tokens) for positive outcomes and financial growth
- **Amber/Yellow** (`--warning`) for tax alerts and cautions
- **Red** (`--destructive`) - **ONLY** for critical failures or security breaches

### Component Patterns
- Strictly follow patterns found in `src/components/ui/`
- Use shadcn/ui components with proper variants
- All colors must use HSL semantic tokens from `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`
- Never hardcode colors directly in components

---

## Coding Standards

### Type Safety
- **Use strict TypeScript** for ALL financial calculations
- **Prefer `interface` over `type`** for object shapes
- Define explicit interfaces for all financial data structures
- Avoid `any` type in financial logic - use proper typing or `unknown` with type guards
- Validate all numerical inputs before calculations

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Use interface
interface TaxCalculation {
  taxableIncome: number;
  federalTax: number;
  effectiveRate: number;
}

// ❌ Bad - Avoid any
const calculateTax = (income: any) => { ... }
```

### State Management
- **Use TanStack React Query** for all Supabase data fetching and caching
- Leverage `useQuery` for read operations with proper cache keys
- Use `useMutation` with optimistic updates for write operations
- Implement proper error and loading states

```typescript
// ✅ Good - React Query for data fetching
const { data: accounts } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['accounts', userId],
  queryFn: () => supabase.from('accounts').select('*').eq('user_id', userId)
});

// ❌ Bad - Direct useEffect fetching
useEffect(() => { fetchAccounts(); }, []);
```

---

## Data Security (RLS Required)

- **All database interactions must happen through Supabase client libraries**
- All sensitive user data must be handled via Supabase RLS policies respecting `auth.uid()`
- Never expose user financial data without `auth.uid()` verification
- Mask personally identifiable information (PII) in logs
- Do not store plain-text API keys in code
- Use server-side validation for all financial operations

```sql
-- ✅ Good RLS Policy
CREATE POLICY "Users see own data"
ON public.accounts
FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

---

## 2026 OBBB Act Tax Compliance

### Federal Estate Exemption (2026)
- **$15M individual exemption** (doubled for married couples with portability)
- Apply in all estate calculations via `src/lib/estateCalculator.ts`

### Federal Tax Brackets (MFJ - 2026)
| Rate | Income Range |
|------|-------------|
| 10%  | $0 - $24,000 |
| 12%  | $24,000 - $97,450 |
| 22%  | $97,450 - $201,200 |
| 24%  | $201,200 - $383,900 |
| 32%  | $383,900 - $487,450 |
| 35%  | $487,450 - $731,200 |
| 37%  | $731,200+ |

### IRS Contribution Limits (2026)
- Reference `src/lib/irsLimits2026.ts` for all limits
- Apply SECURE 2.0 **Super Catch-Up** rules for ages 60-63
- High earners (>$150k) have catch-up contributions treated as Roth

---

## Financial Intelligence Rules

### 1. Stepped-up Basis
**Always model the reset of cost basis** for inherited assets at death:
- Brokerage accounts: Full step-up to FMV
- Real estate: Full step-up to FMV
- Reference: `src/lib/estateCalculator.ts` → `calculateStepUpBasis()`

### 2. SECURE Act 2.0 Ten-Year Rule
**Force an empty-account projection within 10 years** for any inherited Traditional IRA by non-spouse beneficiaries:
- Non-spouse heirs must fully distribute inherited IRA within 10 years
- Model tax leakage projections for heirs
- Reference: `src/lib/estateCalculator.ts` → `calculateHeir10YearTaxLiability()`

### 3. Roth Conversion Strategy
**Prioritize Roth conversions during years where the user's marginal tax bracket is lower than their projected retirement bracket**:
- Target the "Lull Period" between retirement and Social Security
- Fill lower brackets (12%, 22%) before income rises
- Factor in IRMAA 2-year lookback for Medicare premiums
- Reference: `src/lib/rothConversionEngine.ts` → `optimizeRothConversions()`

### 4. IRMAA Cliff Detection
- Apply Medicare surcharge warnings at income thresholds
- Reference: `src/lib/rmdCalculator.ts` → `getRMDImpactOnMAGI()`

## Cursor Operational Protocol

### Composer Mode Analysis
**Before refactoring**, always analyze the relationship between:
1. **TaxBracketEngine** (`src/lib/taxBracketEngine.ts`)
2. **WithdrawalEngine** (`src/lib/withdrawalEngine.ts`) 
3. **RothConversionEngine** (`src/lib/rothConversionEngine.ts`)
4. **Success Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `src/pages/Success.tsx`)
5. **Supabase Schema** (`src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`)

### Verification First Protocol
Before changing any logic in the engines above:

**Required steps:**
1. Simulate the outcome with test data
2. Calculate and document the **"Tax Alpha"** gained (money saved/gained)
3. Explain the financial impact in comments

### Zero-Hypotheticals Rule
If a tax rule is ambiguous:
1. Search the codebase for constants in `src/lib/irsLimits2026.ts`
2. Check `src/lib/taxBracketEngine.ts` for bracket definitions
3. Reference `.cursorrules` and project memories before assuming

## Core Logic Files (Single Source of Truth)

**Do Not Duplicate** - Import from these canonical sources:

| Domain | File |
|--------|------|
| Tax Brackets | `src/lib/taxBracketEngine.ts` |
| IRS Limits | `src/lib/irsLimits2026.ts` |
| Social Security | `src/lib/socialSecurityCalculator.ts` |
| RMD Calculator | `src/lib/rmdCalculator.ts` |
| State Taxes | `src/lib/stateTax2026Engine.ts` |
| Estate Planning | `src/lib/estateCalculator.ts` |
| Withdrawal Strategy | `src/lib/withdrawalEngine.ts` |
| Roth Conversion | `src/lib/rothConversionEngine.ts` |

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Import from source
import { IRS_LIMITS_2026 } from '@/lib/irsLimits2026';
import { calculateBenefitAdjustment } from '@/lib/socialSecurityCalculator';

// ❌ Bad - Duplicating constants
const COLA_RATE = 0.028; // Don't define separately
```

## Financial Calculation Best Practices

1. **Avoid floating-point errors** - Round monetary values appropriately
2. **Use consistent rounding** - `Math.round(value * 100) / 100` for cents
3. **Handle edge cases** - Zero balances, negative values, undefined inputs
4. **Document assumptions** - Comment inflation rates, return assumptions
5. **Cite sources** - Reference IRS notices for tax constants

---

## AI Advisor Guidelines

- Ground all advice in user's actual plan data
- Include disclaimers for complex tax strategies
- Reference specific charts/visualizations when explaining
- Translate financial jargon to plain language
- Use Gemini 3 Flash for AI-powered insights

---

## Performance Optimization

- Use **Web Workers** for heavy simulations (Monte Carlo in `src/workers/`)
- **Memoize** expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- **Lazy-load** scenario comparison charts
- **Cache** static reference data (state tax rules)

---

## Testing Financial Logic

- Unit test all tax calculations with known inputs/outputs
- Test edge cases: age 62, 67, 70 for SS; ages 60-63 for Super Catch-Up
- Validate RMD calculations against IRS Uniform Lifetime Table
- Test IRMAA bracket transitions

---

## Error Handling

- Use structured error responses for financial operations
- Log errors with context but mask sensitive data
- Provide user-friendly error messages for validation failures
- Never fail silently on financial calculations
